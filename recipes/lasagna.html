    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium heat, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
      <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
      <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the greased baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping. Spread a third of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Repeat these layers two more times.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
