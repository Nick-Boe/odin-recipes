# odin-recipes

We're back at it -- Github commits and all! The next year is going to be a deep dive in to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is the beginning of a *real* journey, and I'm pretty stoked about it. Looking forward to reflecting on these humble beginnings a few years down the line when I'm a freaking web dev ninja. For now, the learning, the fumbling, the sharpening of the blade. 

This project is a basic recipe website, as part of The Odin Project's HTML lessons. It's going to start as a brutalist website, with no CSS, and will just be an index with a few recipe links. We'll revisit it later and juzz it up with some CSS.
